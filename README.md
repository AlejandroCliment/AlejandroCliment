# Hi, I’m Alejandro Climent 

**AI Engineer at Sopra Steria**  
I currently build **computer vision** and **applied ML** systems, from data preparation to production deployment.  
In parallel, I keep learning and working on personal projects.

- 🧠 **Areas:** Computer Vision, Statistical Learning, Robotics, Deep Learning, Generative AI, Reinforcement Learning  
- 📚 **Especially interested in:** staying up to date and continuously learning in AI (papers, courses, experimentation)  
- 🎓 **Education:** BSc in Robotics Engineering · MSc in Artificial Intelligence  

---

## What I build
- End-to-end **Computer Vision** systems (detection/segmentation/tracking)  
- **Training & evaluation pipelines**: dataset → experiments → metrics → reproducible models  
- **Optimization & deployment**: efficient inference, model export (ONNX), **TensorRT**, profiling, and automation  
- **Classical ML** when it fits: feature engineering, regularization, calibration, interpretability  
- **Generative AI prototypes**: RAG, embeddings, evaluation, and basic guardrails  
- Product integration: APIs, tooling, tests, and monitoring
